t , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

As part of the autonomy package was the introduction of the Papuan People 's Council tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs , however , the implementation of the autonomy measures has been criticized as half-hearted and incomplete . 91 Papua , formerly known as Irian Jaya , was granted special autonomy status in 2001 .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , have severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . ; The deadliest killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 . The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda . National flags at the site of the 2002 terrorist bombing in Kuta , Bali Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966 , in particular from the United States , western Europe , Australia , and Japan . Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy . The highest representative body at national level is the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) .

The president serves a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms . The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice president . The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence .

A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands .

The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence .

A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands .

For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances .

Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling .

Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources . A Wayang kulit shadow puppet performance as seen by the audience Magnis-Suseno , F. 1981 , Javanese Ethics and World-View The Javanese Idea of the Good Life , PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama , Jakarta , 1997 , pp.15-18 , ISBN 979-605-406-X ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp.28 , 62 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , p.22 ; A large proportion of Indonesians such as the Javanese abangan , Balinese Hindus , and Dayak Christians practice a less orthodox , syncretic form of their religion , which draws on local customs and beliefs . 25 , 26 , 28 ; and the Protestant denominations are largely a result of Dutch Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country 's colonial period . Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) . On the other hand , Papua has 500 or more indigenous Papuan and Austronesian languages , in a region of just 2.7 million people . Retrieved on August 14 , 2007 . - The World Factbook . Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited . Map of Indonesia Papua Maluku islands Sulawesi Kalimantan Lesser Sunda Islands Java Sumatra † indicates provinces with Special Status ( Indonesian name in brackets where different from English ) ; Indonesian provinces and their capitals ; Jakarta is the country 's special capital region . As part of the autonomy package was the introduction of the Papuan People 's Council tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs , however , the implementation of the autonomy measures has been criticized as half-hearted and incomplete . 91 Papua , formerly known as Irian Jaya , was granted special autonomy status in 2001 .

People 's Representative Council ( 1999 ) . 22/1999 Regarding Regional Governance . ( Elucidation on the Indonesia Law No . The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , have severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . ; The deadliest killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 . The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda . National flags at the site of the 2002 terrorist bombing in Kuta , Bali Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966 , in particular from the United States , western Europe , Australia , and Japan . Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial .

Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna .

The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java .

Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels .

Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 .

Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs .

Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , have severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . ; The deadliest killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 . The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda . National flags at the site of the 2002 terrorist bombing in Kuta , Bali Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966 , in particular from the United States , western Europe , Australia , and Japan . Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy . The highest representative body at national level is the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) .

The president serves a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms . The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice president . The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity .

Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population .

A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence .

Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces .

Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances .

Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java .

The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive .

Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

As part of the autonomy package was the introduction of the Papuan People 's Council tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs , however , the implementation of the autonomy measures has been criticized as half-hearted and incomplete . 91 Papua , formerly known as Irian Jaya , was granted special autonomy status in 2001 .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling .

Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources . A Wayang kulit shadow puppet performance as seen by the audience Magnis-Suseno , F. 1981 , Javanese Ethics and World-View The Javanese Idea of the Good Life , PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama , Jakarta , 1997 , pp.15-18 , ISBN 979-605-406-X ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp.28 , 62 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , p.22 ; A large proportion of Indonesians such as the Javanese abangan , Balinese Hindus , and Dayak Christians practice a less orthodox , syncretic form of their religion , which draws on local customs and beliefs . 25 , 26 , 28 ; and the Protestant denominations are largely a result of Dutch Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country 's colonial period . Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) . On the other hand , Papua has 500 or more indigenous Papuan and Austronesian languages , in a region of just 2.7 million people . Retrieved on August 14 , 2007 . - The World Factbook . Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited . Map of Indonesia Papua Maluku islands Sulawesi Kalimantan Lesser Sunda Islands Java Sumatra † indicates provinces with Special Status ( Indonesian name in brackets where different from English ) ; Indonesian provinces and their capitals ; Jakarta is the country 's special capital region . As part of the autonomy package was the introduction of the Papuan People 's Council tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs , however , the implementation of the autonomy measures has been criticized as half-hearted and incomplete . 91 Papua , formerly known as Irian Jaya , was granted special autonomy status in 2001 . Chapter VII Transitional Provisions , Art . The President of Republic of Indonesia ( 1974 ) . 122 ; ( translated version ) . Chapter XIV Other Provisions , Art . People 's Representative Council ( 1999 ) . 22/1999 Regarding Regional Governance . ( Elucidation on the Indonesia Law No . The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , have severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . ; The deadliest killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 . The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda . National flags at the site of the 2002 terrorist bombing in Kuta , Bali Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966 , in particular from the United States , western Europe , Australia , and Japan . Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy . The highest representative body at national level is the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) .

The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Private radio stations carry their own news bulletins and foreign broadcasters supply programs . The TV market includes ten national commercial networks , and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI . Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence .

A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling .

Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources . A Wayang kulit shadow puppet performance as seen by the audience Magnis-Suseno , F. 1981 , Javanese Ethics and World-View The Javanese Idea of the Good Life , PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama , Jakarta , 1997 , pp.15-18 , ISBN 979-605-406-X ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp.28 , 62 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , p.22 ; A large proportion of Indonesians such as the Javanese abangan , Balinese Hindus , and Dayak Christians practice a less orthodox , syncretic form of their religion , which draws on local customs and beliefs . 25 , 26 , 28 ; and the Protestant denominations are largely a result of Dutch Calvinist and Lutheran missionary efforts during the country 's colonial period . Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) . On the other hand , Papua has 500 or more indigenous Papuan and Austronesian languages , in a region of just 2.7 million people . Retrieved on August 14 , 2007 . - The World Factbook . Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited . Map of Indonesia Papua Maluku islands Sulawesi Kalimantan Lesser Sunda Islands Java Sumatra † indicates provinces with Special Status ( Indonesian name in brackets where different from English ) ; Indonesian provinces and their capitals ; Jakarta is the country 's special capital region . As part of the autonomy package was the introduction of the Papuan People 's Council tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs , however , the implementation of the autonomy measures has been criticized as half-hearted and incomplete . 91 Papua , formerly known as Irian Jaya , was granted special autonomy status in 2001 . Chapter VII Transitional Provisions , Art . The President of Republic of Indonesia ( 1974 ) . 122 ; ( translated version ) . Chapter XIV Other Provisions , Art . People 's Representative Council ( 1999 ) . 22/1999 Regarding Regional Governance . ( Elucidation on the Indonesia Law No . The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , have severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . ; The deadliest killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 . The Indonesian Government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda . National flags at the site of the 2002 terrorist bombing in Kuta , Bali Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966 , in particular from the United States , western Europe , Australia , and Japan . Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members .

As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger .

Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce .

Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) . The attacks , and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries , have severely damaged Indonesia 's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects . ; The deadliest killed 202 people ( including 164 international tourists ) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002 .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy . The highest representative body at national level is the People 's Consultative Assembly ( MPR ) .

The president serves a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms . The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice president . The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) . On the other hand , Papua has 500 or more indigenous Papuan and Austronesian languages , in a region of just 2.7 million people . Retrieved on August 14 , 2007 . - The World Factbook . Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling .

Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands .

For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE .

The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses .

Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed .

For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s .

Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 473–475 , 484 Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president appoints a council of ministers , who are not required to be elected members of the legislature . The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 237 - 280 An attempted coup on September 30 1965 was countered by the army , who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded . Austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to South East Asia from Taiwan . cited in ; cited in cited in ; Fossilized remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling .

Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment .

Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Private radio stations carry their own news bulletins and foreign broadcasters supply programs . The TV market includes ten national commercial networks , and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI . Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto 's rule , during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media , and restricted foreign media . Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence .

A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) .

Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests .

Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . The name Indonesia derives from the Latin Indus , meaning `` India '' , and the Greek nesos , meaning `` island '' . The country is richly endowed with natural resources , yet poverty is a defining feature of contemporary Indonesia . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . However , sectarian tensions and separatism have led to violent confrontations that have undermined political and economic stability . `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka tunggal ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' lit . As a unitary state and a nation , Indonesia has developed a shared identity defined by a national language , a majority Muslim population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . The Javanese are the largest and politically dominant ethnic group . Across its many islands , Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic , linguistic , and religious groups . Indonesia 's history has since been turbulent , with challenges posed by natural disasters , corruption , separatism , a democratization process , and periods of rapid economic change . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Muslim traders brought Islam , and European powers fought one another to monopolize trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Exploration . Under Indian influence , Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished from the early centuries CE . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the seventh century , when the Srivijaya Kingdom formed trade links with China . Other neighboring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor and Malaysia . The nation 's capital city is Jakarta . Indonesia is a republic , with an elected parliament and president . With a population of over 234 million people , it is the world 's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority nation , although officially it is not an Islamic state . Comprising 17,508 islands , it is the world 's largest archipelagic state .

Vickers ( 2005 ) pages 3 to 7 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 74 , 180 Many of Indonesia 's peoples have strongly-rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include Dutch author Multatuli , who criticized treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule ; Sumatrans Muhammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians ; Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 299–301 and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia 's most famous novelist . The oldest evidence of writing in Indonesia is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century CE . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of Indonesian films released each year has steadily increased . The Indonesian film industry 's popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia , although it declined significantly in the early 1990s . Dangdut is a popular contemporary genre of pop music that draws influence from Arabic , Indian , and Malay folk music . Indonesian traditional music includes gamelan and keroncong . Compared to the infused flavors of Vietnamese and Thai food , flavors in Indonesia are kept relatively separate , simple and substantial . Spices ( notably chili ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients . Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . A selection of Indonesian food , including Soto Ayam ( chicken noodle soup ) , sate kerang ( shellfish kebabs ) , telor pindang ( preserved eggs ) , perkedel ( fritter ) , and es teh manis ( sweet iced tea ) Sports in Indonesia are generally male-orientated and spectator sports are often associated with illegal gambling . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as , caci in Flores , and pasola in Sumba . Traditional sports include sepak takraw , and bull racing in Madura . The most popular sports in Indonesia are badminton and football ; Liga Indonesia is the country 's premier football club league . The most dominant influences on Indonesian architecture have traditionally been Indian ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European architectural influences have been significant . Textiles such as batik , ikat and songket are created across Indonesia in styles that vary by region . Traditional Javanese and Balinese dances , for example , contain aspects of Hindu culture and mythology , as do wayang kulit ( shadow puppet ) performances . Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups , each with cultural differences developed over centuries , and influenced by Arabic , Chinese , Malay , and European sources .

Roman Catholicism was brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries , Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pp . Islam was first adopted by Indonesians in northern Sumatra in the 13th century , through the influence of traders , and became the country 's dominant religion by the 16th century . Though now minority religions , Hinduism and Buddhism remain defining influences in Indonesian culture . Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese , and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are ethnic Chinese . 11 % of the population is Christian , of which roughly two-thirds are Protestant 2 % are Hindu , and 1 % Buddhist . Although it is not an Islamic state , Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority nation , with almost 86 % of Indonesians declared Muslim according to the 2000 census . Although religious freedom is stipulated in the Indonesian constitution , the government officially recognizes only six religions Islam ; Protestantism ; Roman Catholicism ; Hinduism ; Buddhism ; and Confucianism . Indonesia has the world 's largest Muslim population . Medan 's Masjid Raya ( 'Great Mosque ' ) .

Of these , Javanese is the most widely-spoken , the language of the largest ethnic group . Most Indonesians speak at least one of the several hundred local languages ( bahasa daerah ) , often as their first language . Indonesian was first promoted by nationalists in the 1920s , and declared the official language on independence in 1945 . It was originally a lingua franca for most of the region , including present-day Malaysia , and is thus closely related to Malay . It is the language of business , politics , national media , education , and academia . The official national language , Indonesian , is universally taught in schools , and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian . ; ; The riots in Jakarta in 1998 much of which were aimed at the Chinese were , in part , expressions of this resentment . Much of the country 's privately-owned commerce and wealth is Chinese-controlled , Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 53 , 80–81 ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 85–87 , 164–165 , 233–237 which has contributed to considerable resentment , and even anti-Chinese violence . Domestic migration ( including the official Transmigrasi program ) are a cause of violence such as the massacre of hundreds of Madurese by a local Dayak community in West Kalimantan , and conflicts in Maluku , Central Sulawesi , and parts of Papua and West Papua ; ; ; Kyoto University Sulawesi Kaken Team & Center for Southeast Asian Studies Chinese Indonesians are an influential ethnic minority comprising less than 2 % of the population . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 256 Society is largely harmonious , although social , religious and ethnic tensions have triggered horrendous violence . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strongly maintained regional identities . Small but significant populations of ethnic Chinese , Indians , Europeans and Arabs are concentrated mostly in urban areas . The Sundanese , ethnic Malays , and Madurese are the largest non-Javanese groups . ; The largest is the Javanese , who comprise 42 % of the population , and are politically and culturally dominant . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 , ; There are around 300 distinct native ethnicities in Indonesia , and 742 different languages and dialects . The other major grouping are Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia . Most Indonesians are descendant from Austronesian-speaking peoples , who originated from Taiwan . A Minangkabau woman in traditional dress Despite a fairly effective family planning program , which has been in place since the 1960s , the population is expected to grow to around 315 million in 2035 , based on the current estimated annual growth rate of 1.25 % . 130 million people live on the island of Java , the world 's most populous island . The national population from the 2000 national census is 206 million , and the Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau and Statistics Indonesia estimate a population of 222 million for 2006 . As of 2006 , an estimated 17.8 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 49.0 % of the population live on less than US $ 2 per day . In 2005 , the Government was forced to reduce its large subsidies on fuel prices drastically as international oil prices climbed , which was a major contributor to inflation and hardship . This growth rate , however , is not enough to make a significant impact on unemployment , ( subsequent correction ) ; and stagnant wages growth , and increases in fuel and rice prices have worsened poverty levels . GDP growth , however , exceeded 5 % in both 2004 and 2005 , and is forecast to increase further . ; ; ( subsequent correction ) ( Transparency International , for example , ranked Indonesia 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ) . Political instability since 1998 , slow economic reform , and corruption at all levels of government and business , have contributed to the patchy nature of the recovery . 10,000 , and there has been a slow but significant economic recovery . The rupiah has since stabilized at around Rp . 18,000 , and the economy shrunk by 13.7 % . 2,000 to Rp . Against the US dollar , the currency dropped from about Rp . Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ; foreign investment flowed into Indonesia , particularly into the rapidly developing export-orientated manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997 , the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7 % . Reforms included a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness , and de-regulation of the financial sector ( Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 ) . A range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s . Following a slowing of growth in the 1980s , due to over regulation and dependence on declining oil prices , growth slowed to an average of 4.3 % per annum between 1981 and 1988 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following further reforms in the late 1980s , averaging over 7 % from 1968 to 1981 . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Indonesia is Southeast Asia 's only member of OPEC , and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates . Schwarz ( 1994 ) , pages 52–57 Following President Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down , stabilized the currency , rescheduled foreign debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment . By the time of Sukarno 's downfall in the mid-1960s , the economy was in chaos with 1,000 % annual inflation , shrinking export revenues , crumbling infrastructure , factories operating at minimal capacity , and negligible investment . In the 1960s , the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability , a young and inexperienced government , and ill-disciplined economic nationalism , which resulted in severe poverty and hunger . Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and its largest commercial center Indonesia 's major imports include machinery and equipment , chemicals , fuels , and foodstuffs . The country has extensive natural resources , including crude oil , natural gas , tin , copper , and gold . In 2005 , Indonesia ran a trade surplus with export revenues of US $ 83.64 billion and import expenditure of US $ 62.02 billion . The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Japan ( 18.0 % ) , China ( 16.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 12.8 % ) . Indonesia 's main export markets are Japan ( 22.3 % of Indonesian exports in 2005 ) , the United States ( 13.9 % ) , China ( 9.1 % ) , and Singapore ( 8.9 % ) . Major agricultural products include palm oil , rice , tea , coffee , spices , and rubber . Major industries include petroleum and natural gas , textiles , apparel , and mining . This is followed by the services sector ( 36.9 % ) and industry ( 18.8 % ) . However , agriculture employs more people than other sectors , accounting for 44.3 % of the 95 million-strong workforce . This is followed by industry ( 40.7 % ) and agriculture ( 14.0 % ) . The services sector is the economy 's largest and accounts for 45.3 % of GDP ( 2005 ) . In 2007 , estimated nominal per capita GDP is US $ 1,812 , and per capita GDP PPP was US $ 4,616 ( International Dollars ) . Indonesia 's estimated Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for 2007 is US $ 408 billion ( US $ 1,038 bn PPP ) . Agriculture has been the country 's largest employer for centuries . Using water buffalo to plough rice fields in Java . Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species , including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered , including the Sumatran Orangutan . Issues include large-scale deforestation ( much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore ; over-exploitation of marine resources ; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization and economic development , including air pollution , traffic congestion , garbage management , and reliable water and waste water services . Indonesia 's high population and rapid industrialization present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the surrounding area , , which is now termed Wallacea . West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian ; moving east from Lombok , they are increasingly Australian . Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north-south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . The British naturalist , Alfred Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , sea grass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia 's 80,000 kilometers ( 50,000 mi ) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country 's high level of biodiversity . ; Papua was part of the Australian landmass , and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku having been long separated from the continental landmasses have developed their own unique flora and fauna . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture . In Sumatra and Kalimantan , these are predominantly of Asian species . Forests cover approximately 60 % of the country . Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Once linked to the Asian mainland , the islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Borneo , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) have a wealth of Asian fauna . Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography , support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity ( after Brazil ) , and its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species . The critically endangered Sumatran Orangutan , a great ape endemic to Indonesia Temperatures vary little throughout the year ; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C ( 79–86 °F ) . Humidity is generally high , averaging about 80 % . Mountainous areas particularly in the west coast of Sumatra , West Java , Kalimantan , Sulawesi , and Papua receive the highest rainfall . Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimeters ( 70–125 in ) , and up to 6,100 millimeters ( 240 in ) in mountainous regions . Lying along the equator , Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons . However , volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra , and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006 . The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago , was one of the largest eruptions ever , and a global catastrophe . Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes , including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century . Indonesia 's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates , makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . Indonesia 's seismic and volcanic activity is among the world 's highest . Mount Semeru and Mount Bromo in East Java . The country 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan , and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements . At 4,884 meters ( 16,024 ft ) , Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake , with an area of 1,145 square kilometers ( 442 sq mi ) . Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometer ( 347 per sq mi ) , 79th in the world , although Java , the world 's most populous island , has a population density of 940 people per square kilometer ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . At 1,919,440 square kilometers ( 741,050 sq mi ) , Indonesia is the world 's 16th-largest country in terms of land area . The capital , Jakarta , is on Java and is the nation 's largest city , followed by Surabaya , Bandung , Medan , and Semarang . Indonesia also shares borders with Singapore , Malaysia , and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south across narrow straits of water . Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on the island of Borneo , Sebatik , Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea , and East Timor on the island of Timor . The five largest islands are Java , Sumatra , Kalimantan ( the Indonesian part of Borneo ) , New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) , and Sulawesi . ; These are scattered over both sides of the equator . Indonesia consists of 17,508 islands , about 6,000 of which are inhabited .

The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Paku Alam , respectively , much like a sultanate . Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution . The Acehnese government , for example , has the right to create an independent legal system ; in 2003 , it instituted a form of Sharia ( Islamic law ) . Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua provinces have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life , and handles matters of a village or neighborhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa ( village chief ) . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and ( kota ) , which are further subdivided into subdistricts ( kecamatan ) , and again into village groupings ( either desa or kelurahan ) . Each province has its own political legislature and governor . Administratively , Indonesia consists of 33 provinces , five of which have special status . Provinces of Indonesia ; Friend ( 2003 ) , pages 270–273 , 477–480 ; Following a sporadic thirty year guerrilla war between the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) and the Indonesian military , a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. ; In Papua , there has been a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In the post-Suharto period since 1998 , formal TNI representation in parliament has been removed ; though curtailed , its political influence remains extensive . Defense spending in the national budget was 4 % of GDP in 2006 , and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations . The army has about 233,000 active-duty personnel . Indonesia 's 300,000-member armed forces ( TNI ) include the Army ( TNI-AD ) , Navy ( TNI-AL , which includes marines ) , and Air Force ( TNI-AU ) .

Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , and a member of OPEC , the Cairns Group and the WTO . It announced its intention to `` resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities '' on September 19 1966 , and was invited to re-join the UN on September 28 1966. and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 , Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the UN on January 20 1965 in response to the fact that Malaysia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council . The nation restored relations with the People 's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era . Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbors in Asia , and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . In contrast to Sukarno 's antipathy to western powers and hostility to Malaysia , Indonesia 's foreign relations approach since the Suharto `` New Order '' has been one of international cooperation and accommodation , to gain external support for Indonesia 's political stability and economic development . Other courts include the Commercial Court , which handles bankruptcy and insolvency ; a State Administrative Court to hear administrative law cases against the government ; a Constitutional Court to hear disputes concerning legality of law , general elections , dissolution of political parties , and the scope of authority of state institutions ; and a Religious Court to deal with specific religious cases . The Supreme Court is the country 's highest court , and hears final cassation appeals and conducts case reviews . Most civil disputes appear before a State Court ; appeals are heard before the High Court . Based on the 2001 constitution amendment , the DPD comprises four popularly elected non-partisan members from each of the thirty-three provinces for national political representation . ( see Harijanti and Lindsey 2006 ) The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management . Reforms include total control of statutes production without executive branch interventions ; all members are now elected ( reserved seats for military representatives have now been removed ) ; and the introduction of fundamental rights exclusive to the DPR . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR 's role in national governance . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch ; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( DPR ) , with 550 members , and the Regional Representatives Council ( DPD ) , with 168 members . It has the power to impeach the president . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating the president , and formalizing broad outlines of state policy .

The president of Indonesia is the head of state , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia In 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches . Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998 , Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms . As a unitary state , power is concentrated in the national government . Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 . Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas . Political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , and terrorism have slowed progress . The Reformasi era following Suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . ; In 1999 , East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia , after a twenty-five-year occupation , which was marked by international condemnation of repression and human rights abuses . Suharto resigned on May 21 1998 . and led to popular protests . This increased popular discontent with the New Order In 1997 and 1998 , however , Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the East Asian Financial Crisis .

Sukarno moved from democracy towards authoritarianism , and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the Military , Islam , and the Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Sukarno , Indonesia 's founding president ; ; ; ; Reid ( 1973 ) , page 30 The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule , and a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader , declared independence and was appointed president . The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during WWII ended Dutch rule , ; and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement . ( Schwartz 1999 , pages 3–4 ) Despite major internal political , social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra and Pattimura in Maluku , and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over these territories was tenuous ; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 24 Following bankruptcy , the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony . In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power . Dutch and British traders followed . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 12–14 The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java . Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , pages 3 to 14 Other Indonesia areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . Although Muslim traders first traveled through South East Asia early in the Islamic era , the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia ; this period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 22–26 ; Ricklefs ( 1991 ) , page 3 Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . From the seventh century CE , the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it . Once one of the world 's most valuable commodities , it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia . The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia 's Banda Islands . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 3 , 9 , 10–11 , 13 , 14–15 , 18–20 , 22–23 ; Vickers ( 2005 ) , pages 18–20 , 60 , 133–134 Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history . For example , trade links with both Indian kingdoms and China were established several centuries BCE . Indonesia 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade . allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . Taylor ( 2003 ) , pages 5–7 Ideal agricultural conditions , and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE , They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE , and confined the native Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they expanded .

Picture a ship carved on Borobudur , circa 800 CE . As early as the first century CE Indonesian vessels made trade voyages as far as Africa . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat ( Ki Hajar Dewantara ) , when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913 . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayichen Archipels , 1884–1894 . From 1900 , the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . ( This term was introduced in 1860 in the influential novel Max Havelaar ( 1859 ) , written by Multatuli , critical of Dutch colonialism ) . Instead , they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ) , popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and even Insulinde . ; However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . In the same publication , a student of Earl 's , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . In 1850 , George Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians and , his preference , Malayunesians for the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia .
